This project implements Raft, an algorithm for distributed consensus.

A detailed description of the implementation is in
[IMPLEMENTATION.pdf](IMPLEMENTATION.pdf). It's somewhat out of date since I've
made changes since it was written, but remains largely accurate. Alterations are
described in the Git log.

`optparse.h` is the work of Christopher Wellons (see
<https://github.com/skeeto/optparse>), used here with thanks.
